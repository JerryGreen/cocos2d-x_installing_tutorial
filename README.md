Welcome to the cocos2d-x installing guide!

# Installing on Windows

### [Download and install Cocos2d-x and Cocos from official site](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download)

Cocos2d-x is for developing only. Cocos(Studio) is for designing mostly. I recommend "Cocos for Mac/Win with framework" option (they both are included).

### [Download and install Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

> `IMPORTANT` You don't need that if you have chosen "Cocos for Mac/Win with framework". It's already included.

It's very important to install 2.7.x version and not 3+. It's also important to add python.exe to Path:

### [Install common tools for Visual C++](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs)

That's minimal requirements for compiling cocos2d-x games for Windows:

### If you plan to compile .apk for Android

I recommend to install following things to "C:\Cocos\tools", cause of Cocos Studio uses this path by default for Python (although it's not necessary).

#### [Download and install NDK](http://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html)

Download the latest version of the installer. Install it. Easy.

#### [Download and install JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

Download the latest version of the installer. Install it. Easy.

#### [Download and install SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

Scroll down to "Other Download Options" > "SDK Tools Only". Download the latest version of the installer. Unzip it to somewhere (remember that I recommend "C:\Cocos\tools"?).

# Creating/running/compiling a project with Cocos Studio

Start the Cocos Studio (finally!).

## Setting up some preferences

Go to "Edit" > "Preferences" > "Platform".

You should see something like this:

If you are following my guide it's already installed. All that you need is to click "Browse..." and find all kinds of that shit (SDK, NDK, JDK).
